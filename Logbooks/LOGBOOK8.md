# Trabalho realizado na Semana #8 - SQL Injection Attack

For this week we where proposed to do tasks presented on this link: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Web/Web_SQL_Injection/

## Task 1 - Get Familiar with SQL Statements

The task was to select the data of the user "Alice". As SQL is already well known, we easily arrive at the correct command to complete the task:

```sql
SELECT * FROM credentials WHERE Name = "Alice";
```

This is how we obtained all of Aliceâ€™s personal data:

## Task 2 - SQL Injection Attack on SELECT Statement

### Task 2.1 - Login in adminstrator mode from webpage

We access the website "www.seed-server.com" provided by the Docker container and also the file `unsafe_home.php`. Then we could see that the query used is fragile because the server creates the command dynamically with unsanitized strings from the user input:



# CTF - Control The Flag

When entering the website we are presented with a login page. To unlock the vault we need to provide an valid username and password combination.
The goal for this CTF is to log in as valid user. To achieve that, we can use SQL Injection, since the user inputs are not verified, nor used as parameters for the query.

This is the SQL query executed:
```php
$query = "SELECT username FROM user WHERE username = '".$username."' AND password = '".$password."'";
```

The input used is: `' or 1=1;#`
This input is always true and comments the part where the password is verified.

This is the SQL query that is actually executed:
```php
$query = "SELECT username FROM user WHERE username = '"' or 1=1;#"' AND password = '".$password."'";
```
We can successfully login and obtain the flag.
